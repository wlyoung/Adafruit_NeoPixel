Adafruit NeoPixel library
=========================

The Handibot LED Arduino Sketch is based on the Adafruit Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strips such as the [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip], the [Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixel][flora], the [Adafruit Breadboard-friendly RGB Smart Pixel][pixel], the [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick][stick], and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield].The Handibot sketch uses the Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip listed below

Handibot LED sketch based on Adafruit NeoPixel library
======================================================

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED strips on a Handibot Smart Power Tool. It?s based on the strandtest example in the Adafruit Arduino library for controlling NeoPixel LED pixels and strips, such as the Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip that we use.

After downloading, rename the folder to 'Adafruit_NeoPixel' and install in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->Adafruit_NeoPixel->Handibot_LED->Handibot_LED.


The Arduino we use is the Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz from Sparkfun. Connection information is included in the comments in the Sketch.

Handibot LED sketch based on Adafruit NeoPixel library
======================================================

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED strips on a Handibot Smart Power Tool. It’s based on the strandtest example in the Adafruit Arduino library for controlling NeoPixel single-wire-based LED pixels and strips, such as the Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip that we use.

Install the 'Adafruit_NeoPixel' library in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->Adafruit_NeoPixel->Handibot_LED->Handibot_LED.


The Arduino we use is the “Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz” from Sparkfun. In the TOOLS menu item in the Arduino IDE, select BOARD and then check “Arduino Duemilanova W/ATMega 328”. Connection information is included in the comments in the Sketch.

Open the “Handibot_LED” sketch. Modify if needed and then upload to Arduino using small FDTI to USB programming board. Make sure BLK and GRN markings on FTDI board match the ones on Arduino.
